# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Aquara?

Aquara is building the world’s first decentralized water fund and governance layer.  
We’re creating a system where everyday people—not just governments or corporations—have a real voice in how water assets are managed, protected, and financed.

Join us as we work toward launch and a future where water is governed by the community, for the community.

### How is Aquara different from a water ETF or NGO donation?

Aquara is about **active participation**. Unlike passive investments or one-time donations, AQA holders get to vote on how funds are spent, what projects are built, and how water resources are managed over time.

---

### What gives AQA its value?

AQA’s value comes from a growing reserve of real assets like water-related investments and Bitcoin. The Aquara DAO manages these reserves to ensure long-term growth, stability, and real-world impact—giving AQA both use and backing.

---

### Is AQA a security token?

No. AQA is a **utility token** used for governance and participation in the Aquara ecosystem. We're working with legal experts to ensure full compliance with regulations, especially across regions.

---

### Why Cardano?

Cardano is ideal for Aquara because it’s **energy-efficient** and has strong tools for **governance** and **identity integration**. It’s a perfect fit for a project focused on transparency, voting, and responsible infrastructure.

---

### Is Aquara a water utility company that runs water plants?

No. Aquara does **not** operate water utilities. Instead, we act as a decentralized **governance and funding layer** over existing infrastructure—helping coordinate investments, community oversight, and smart resource management.

---

### Who owns the water assets?

The Aquara Foundation legally holds the water-related assets.  
AQA holders don’t own water directly, but they influence how these reserves are managed and grown through DAO governance.

---

### Are you trying to own water?

No. Aquara invests in **access-related assets**—such as infrastructure, delivery systems, and usage rights—not in water as a commodity.

---

### How will Aquara stay accountable long-term?

Through:
- **On-chain governance**
- **Regular audits**
- **Transparent community reporting**

AQA holders help decide how funds are used, what projects move forward, and how the Foundation is overseen.

---

### How will Aquara source Bitcoin responsibly?

We’ll prioritize buying Bitcoin from miners using **renewable energy**—solar, wind, or hydro.  
While we can’t guarantee 100% green BTC, we’ll support and partner with operations that are transparent and sustainable.

---

### Why does Aquara matter?

Because **water is life**—and its future shouldn’t be controlled by the few.  
Aquara builds a system where the people have a say in how water is protected, invested in, and shared.  
It’s about long-term impact—not short-term profit.
